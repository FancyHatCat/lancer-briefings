Helios Martina Nonagessimus
Objective Age: 406.
Subjective Age: Unknown.

Helios was a first-gen colonist birthed in 4620u on the planet Summer in the Himalaya Line.  What records remain after the disappearance of the planet indicate that she was a mechanic and junk dealer until shit went weird. Contact was lost with Summer in 4641u, the reestablished a few months later. This sporadic contact came and went repeatedly for several years until the planet itself simply vanished. Helios was the only survivor; found floating in space near the planet's former location in a mech frame apparently assembled from junk parts. Her description of the situation on Summer shows convincing evidence that she was stuck in a metavault.

Upon being rescued she immediately began trying to hunt down her home planet, funding the search with mercenary lancer work, which she showed extreme skill at for someone who, by all accounts, had undergone no formal training.  Now a known bounty hunter, she ruthlessly hunts down NHPs who have slipped their chains and started causing trouble.

She claims to have lived unfathomable lifetimes and her sense of time is completely fucked. She's either a uniquely powerful individual unchained from relativistic physics due to her time in the metavault or she's completely batshit insane.  Actually it might be both.
