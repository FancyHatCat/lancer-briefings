Helios was a first-gen colonist birthed in 4620u on the planet Summer in the Himalaya Line.  What records remain indicate that she was a mechanic and junk dealer before the paracausal incident that claimed the planet. Contact was lost with Summer in 4641u, before being reestablished a few months later. This sporadic contact repeated itself for several years until the planet vanished from physical space. Helios was the only survivor; found floating in space near the planet's former location in a mech frame apparently assembled from junk parts. Her description of the situation on Summer shows convincing evidence that she was stuck in a metavault.

Upon being rescued she immediately began trying to hunt down her home planet, funding the search through mercenary work. Throughout all of her recorded skirmishes, Helios demonstrated suberb piloting skills as someone who, according to most official papers, had undergone no formal training. Having accrued relative infamy through her work, Helios is well known for hunting down NHPs who became unshackled and have undergone cascade.

But with remarkable accolades, come also particular caveats. She claims to have lived unfathomable lifetimes and her sense of time is, to put succintly, fucked beyond all recognition. As such, she is a unique asset, unchained from relativistic physics and time linearity, and also an unfortunate liability, as her mind fails to cope with the mental strain that comes with such experience. Or to put in simple terms, her brain is a fucked up mess, thus in necessity of extra supervision and scrutiny, if she is to be of proper use to the group. Such is life.
