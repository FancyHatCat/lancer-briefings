**NAME:** CÉCILE ZHEN

**BORN:** NEW SAINT MICHEL, CALVADOS SYSTEM, SIERRA MADRE LINE.

**CALLSIGN:** ALCESTE

Busybody, highly stressed. Easy to tease. Like cocktails and has bad sleeping habits. Real fond of the roomba.

Anonymous (Relatively) cyberterrorist and hacker, she is guilty of felony actions within the jurisdiction of nine systems and three separate lines.
Cécile is supposedly an itinerant traveler, like a mysterious dame from an old Cradle noire film, only terrible at playing the part. A lot of greased wheels and backhanded deals were needed to dredge up even a modicum of info on our high-class friend. What I was able to find points to a planned community in the Sumeru system, a projected colonization project scheduled for 28 relativistic years from now, run by the Peridot-Okubo Foundation. 
A supposed non-profit collaborative fund from New Saint Michel, it specializes in bespoke urban planning and synergistic models for far rim-businesses, and has a particular interest in development along Boundary Garden.

Naturally, SSC has its hand so far up the Foundation's ass you can see its artisan-manicured nails in its throat. 

Peridot-Okubo seems to have a underwent an emergency restructuring 30 years ago, in which a large number of well known artisan managers and investment sensei from Constellar worlds were inserted into its governing council, and the amount of data circulating the Omninet of the Sumeru expedition is conspicuously sparse, indicating a rushed launch and uncharacteristic lack of planning for such a meticulous bunch.
You'd almost think they were trying to get out of dodge overnight. But that's not how a colonization project ought to work. Not that it mattered much. 
The convoy she belonged to was targeted by a daring raid by pirates during an unscheduled drop from blinkspace on the Cascade line, and a large amount of materiel and personnel were lost. I'd say their schedule might have been set back... 20-40 years.
Cécile's cybernetic enhancements skirt the boundaries of what could be considered legal under the Union pillars, and she's clearly underwent genetic tampering as well. Not just the usual SSC designer cosmetics but a bucket list of genetic tolerances to exotic materials and abnormal field effects you wouldn't normally see anywhere near an immune system.
Not all of that could be the work of SSC's little hobbyist crew. A supposedly squeaky clean colonial foundation working behind the scenes on illegal cybernetics integrating a great deal of black box technology... It's the stuff of mystery novels. Some of the toys she's strutting around with don't belong to EITHER P.O. or SSC. 
The memory capacity her subjectivity suite packs alone (what shows up on the ship's biometric scans anyway) ought to be enough to store a small moon's entire security network database. 
It makes her particularly useful, personal issues aside. She's no soldier, but killing troubles her less than the average civilian, even if she complains a lot. Funny, that. 

She's responsible for hundreds of cases of cyberterrorism, cracking and other forms of electronic espionage across the Omninet. Billions of manna worth of accounts siphoned and sensitive documents leaked to public forums. 
I've crossed paths with her a couple of times, under various aliases, although she's unaware of it. But there's little substance there. She fiddled around for years, a bored schoolgirl trying out various hobbies and seeing what sticks. 
That is, until the time around her arrival on A.S.7. Looking for her electronic fingerprint is not an easy game to play, but wherever on the Omni she goes, Cécile is interested in finding a particular individual. 
Dates and locale correspond pretty nicely with the date of the pirate raid between the Cascade Line. Just one problem. There's no record of her being picked up by a passing convoy. Nor any record of her making it through the nearest blink gate.

A mystery for the ages. Is what most would say.
