## NAME: QASEM NURANI
## BORN: WEST AGILLAN CITY, AURUM SIGMA VII, ANNA ATARODA
## CALLSIGN: SEQUENCE

Born to lineage of Neo-Persian Seveners who can trace their origins
back to the first wave of AS7 colonists, Qasem moved to Port Esmeralda at a
young age to live with his aunt, after his father contracted & perished
from Halpert's Disease (AFS). Worked at South Agillan Motor Pool.
Received Everest training from independent security force based out of
Port Esmeralda.

Good mechanical aptitude, he presents a strong, reliable work ethic. He's also an idealist, yet tempered by real
world experience. High emotional intelligence, but lonely. Works himself
to the bone as a coping mechanism. Easily manipulated. As a Diasporan, his lack
of cosmopolitan experience turns him a potential liability now that he is
uprooted.

Values good engineering, showing preference for IPS-N and HA frames.
Favors heavy armor vis a vis Tortuga-class. Although lacking in formal combat training, he compensates through a high spread weaponry. Owner of above average spatial
intelligence; Sunzi-class blinkspace technology a good match for said
talent.

Having been partnered with NHP HOMA (Hands-On Mechanical Assistant), his acclimation to
NHP partnership has been encouraged, to satisfactory results. Potential
convert/recruit for Adherents, but also at risk of being poached by Horizon
Collective. Inexperienced with unshackling/cascade. No indication that
he has cycled NHP HOMA since fragment acquisition.

Within the dynamics of the group, he fell into the role of "Team Mom." Which is perfect, means I get to babysit less and smoke more.
