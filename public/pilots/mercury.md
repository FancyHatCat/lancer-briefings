**NAME:** KAELYN FORSYTHE

**BORN:** MOONLIT SUMMIT, ESTRION III

**CALLSIGN:** MERCURY

**SUBJECTIVE AGE:** 23

Born to a miner and a mechanic working for a local company in a mountain town on Estrion III, a resource-rich planet with primarily a jungle biome. Orphaned at age fourteen when her parents were killed in a strikebreaking effort by a Harrison Armory expansion force, and joined the resistance two years later. Kaelyn's resistance cell was run by a former commander of her country's now-defunct military, who went by the codename 'Mercury.' Kaelyn was trained accordingly in guerilla warfare -- stealth, scouting, high-intensity firefights, demolitions.

Kaelyn left her homeworld following a catastrophic final battle for the resistance. Guerilla tactics proved no match for Harrison Armory's lineup of mech frames, and the few resistance cells that were left attacked Harrison's starport in a final bid to escape on a stolen ship. Kaelyn believes that Mercury sacrificed herself to make this happen. That ship was shot down after leaving orbit, and Kaelyn's escape pod landed here on nearby Aurum Sigma Seven, where she has been laying low in and around South Agillan City.

Unlike a good number of our assets, Kaelyn is already a trained soldier and survivalist, having survived intense live scenarios against Harrison forces. She displays fierce loyalty to her comrades, and is willing to go all in for them when the chips are down, sometimes to her own detriment. It's likely that she'll form the same bond with the rest of the team. All in all, a reliable unit, and a good asset to have at many combat situations. Unfortunately, that same experience she adquired in Estrion III can become a hindrance when conducting business of with a bureaucratic edge. Having been instilled with an intense anti-corporate sentiment, she is not a player than can be relied on when coming to negotiations. Kaelyn's poker face frankly sucks, and she is not suited at all for diplomatic pursuits. That is not to mention her alcoholism, borne of attempt to cope with her personal traumas. Roderick has been instructed to keep her on a general short leash.

Perhaps more problematic than all of above, is Kaelyn's attachment to the previous Mercury. Though she believes that she is dead, my sources tell me that may not be the case. Unconfirmed sightings on a few mercenary teams over the years, on jobs that, curiously, benefit Harrison Armory. A potential a wrench in the works, if she turns up to play a hand at our table.
