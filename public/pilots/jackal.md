**OBJECTIVE AGE:** 20

**SUBJECTIVE AGE:** UNKNOWN

Layla Nour, former identity Mona Sayed, was a slum dweller who was taken from an orphanage by human traffickers. The Black Jackal Syndicate, as they titled themselves, trained her as a hitman from her youth. Past records as well as current combat data speaks for her efficiency expertise. Expertise that served her well, at least until she drew a bad hand. A car accident, on the way back from a job, at the ripe young age of 21. As far as actual public records go, her story ends there.

As it happens though, the Syndicate was in control of one of the very few flash cloning facilities within the planet. And it turns out that once you have the facilities, the actual raw materials needed to produce a human body are rather inexpensive. With this one little cheat, Miss Sayed continued to serve the Syndicate as an assassin for over a century. A crooked deal for all involved, I say.

Our lady hitman seems to have had a change of heart around ten years prior to the formation of the Orchids. The flash-cloning facilities that had kept the Black Jackals in the good graces of political elites were destroyed and their leaders summarily executed. Whatever was left were rounded up by the local law enforcement.

"Layla Nour" came into existance with the help of independent hackers in South Agillan City, using a combination of two extremely common names to create a plausible backstory for a woman who didn't have any prior connections. Nour retired from her previous persona to become a back-alley private eye, and spent the next years of her life uneventfully tracking down missing children and the like. Mundane, and overall, a period of little importance.

Unfortunately, "Miss Nour" unwittingly jumped from one shitty table to another. Her first mistake was in trusting independent hackers not to keep her old information for themselves, and her second was trusting that they would be as good as they claimed themselves to be. Prior to her joining our numbers, the SSC contacted her in search of a hitman for a job only they know about. They also were the ones to furnish Nour with an Everest, registered to the callsign "Jackal" as an unspoken threat. 

It always amuses me, that they went through this much trouble to draw a former hitman from a backwater planet into one of their plots. So much complexity for something that could be done with far simpler methods. Regardless, that does mean that Layla Nour, being an useful asset as she is, can also be a future liability. She is well aware I know of the leash at her neck. I will let them fish for their Royal Flush all they want.

All I need to win, is a Full House.
