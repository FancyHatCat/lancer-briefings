**CALLSIGN:** MAYHEM

A little surprise that dropped into our laps as an unexpected bonus when a prison hulk suffered a "mysterious mechanical failure" during atmospheric re-entry, and crashed in the sands of Aurum Sigma VII with the loss of almost all crew and "passengers." Not much is known about this woman and her identity. Prisoner records offered little but a slew of documented accounts of the attacks attributed to her and her pirate crew. Digging from further Union sources provided the happy tidbit that they were apprehended when betrayed by a paid turncoat. Their Captain was killed in the operation, and the remainder only subdued by overwhelming force.

Genealogical scans have turned up nothing of interest, and most assume her to have been born somewhere in the ass-end of the Rim planets. One juicy rumor that has come to our attention claims she was born on a Union planet many, many years ago owing to significant time in FTL travel around the Rim. That might explain the paucity of records - if true. That, or she's just someone that nobody ever cared to record a thing about. My chips are on both.

Other information regarding her comes from former partners in crime: attesting to the subject's unpredictability, capacity for violence, fearlessness, lack of restraint or hesitation, bullheadedness, proclivity for addictive behaviors and irrational outbursts, with the only saving grace of an apparent, if unexpressed, loyalty toward her crewmates to complement her skill as a starship pilot.

Any organization of mercenary nature can benefit from individuals with a head and knack for routine violence. Nonetheless, this sort of opportunity must be approached carefully, and with leverage. I have arranged for the safety of her surviving crew members as escapees contingent upon her cooperation with our operations. Of course, that also means her own well-being and ability to stay ahead of Union authorities also rests entirely in our hands. She took to frame piloting with a minimum of training, the quintessential "natural" who adapted her skill in personal combat and technical piloting prowess to an effective know-how. Mildly impressive, but more importantly, highly cost-effective.

Demonstrated expected behavior during her second deployment, throwing her mech on board an enemy shuttle still engaged in dropping mechs onto the moving train we were engaged to defend. Proceeded to attack the shuttle from within, demolishing multiple frames in short order, before blowing herself back to the train with the backblast of one of her projectiles. 

Unfortunately, considering all data we have in hand, she is not one to be trusted. Known to despise core worlders and all sources of authority, but responds to incentives, if sparsely. Thus we must mind our leverage - always. Always keep leash. Or allowed off leash only in desperate circumstances.

Also, I have recommended Roderick to keep the liquor-cabinet locked and hide the key.
