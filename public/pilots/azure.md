Roy's a former employee of the now defunct Azure Lane Shipping Company. he was a "captain" of one of their deep space cargo haulers (read: space trucker). ALSC went belly up due to profit losses from piracy in their shipping corridors, IPS-N swooped in to pick up the pieces. They took ALSC'S clients for their portfolio, ships for their fleet and orbital warehouses for storage, but they left Roy on the floor. 

An avid sim enthusiast, Roy took surprisingly well to mech piloting. He thinks himself an ace but everyone sees him as a joker. Thing is, no card games worth playing keep their jokers. His thrill-seeking and constant need for approval makes him the right sort of reckless for those "impossible" missions. His machine specializes in aerial, high-speed shock tactics but also has been invaluable as close-fire support as well as designated marksman. He may seem like a fish out of water but no man braves the vacuum of space for those long hauls alone without having endurance and a sense for survival. He is more of a jack, he can make a winning hand, just don't try and bet on him alone.
