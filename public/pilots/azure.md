NAME: ROY SPENCER

CALLSIGN: AZURE

OBJECTIVE AGE: UNKNOWN

SUBJECTIVE AGE: 26

Roy's a former employee of the now defunct Azure Lane Shipping Company. he was a "captain" of one of their deep space cargo haulers, a fancy title for what is basically a "space trucker." Much to Roy's chagrin, ALSC went down, due to profit losses from piracy in their shipping corridors, with IPS-N swooping in to pick up the pieces. They took ALSC'S clients for their portfolio, ships for their fleet and orbital warehouses for storage, but left many employees on the floor. Roy was one of them. 

An avid sim enthusiast, Roy took surprisingly well to mech piloting. He likens himself to an Ace, yet to his colleagues' eyes, he is more akin to a Joker. The truth is more in the middle. His thrill-seeking behavior and constant need for approval of his teammates makes him the right sort of reckless for high-stake scenarios. His machine may specialize in aerial, high-speed shock tactics, but also has been invaluable as close-fire support, as well as designated marksman. 

He may seem like a fish out of water, and prone to more mishaps than he himself would like, but no man successfully braves the solitude of space for those long hauls without having high mental tenacity and sense for survival. Factually speaking, Roy Spencer is neither an Ace or a Joker, but indeed a Jack. He can make part of a winning hand, just don't try and bet on him alone.
