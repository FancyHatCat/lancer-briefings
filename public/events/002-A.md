# Word From The Boss...

CO Lady speaking, we are under attack by a hostile ship. The Carrier you're all in is about to be breached from several points. Your orders are to conduct an immediate exfiltration. Destroy all opposition on your way.

Lady out.

**-Maddie**

## -------------------------------------
# Another Day, Another Escape...

The engagement is to happen within the claustrophobic environment of a long abandoned carcass of a carrier. Low visibility and low ceiling are issues to be considered. Expect ambushes, traps, as well as close-quarter centered frames. The objective shall be considered complete once all pilots reach the exit point.
