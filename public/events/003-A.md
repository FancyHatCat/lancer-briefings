# Word From The Boss:

Maddie here. Your job is simple. The four of you shall be sent to one of the many asteroids that composes part of the mining belt, and draw attention to yourselves by making as much noise as possible. Of course, simple does not mean easy. You must expect heavy resistance as you become the center of everyone's attention. Lucky for you, I won't send you alone. The Scorched Sun and our other allies shall provide you with long-range support. But before they are capable of doing so, you must disable the pirates' own long-range systems. Rub their back, and they shall rub yours.

That is all. Show me the results of our endless drills. And good luck on your draw.

Maddie out.

# Mission Details:

The area where the mission shall occur in a well guarded section of the belt. The squadron shall start at altitude 10 as they descend into the site. Expect a heavy focus on close quarters encounters, with long-range support. Pilots must also be ready to encounter well-known and infamous piracy-focused systems. A total of three AA Guns sit on this site. To receive support from the Scorched Sun, the squadron must disable all three of them.
