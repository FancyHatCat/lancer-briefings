# Word From The Boss:

CO Lady speaking, we are under attack by a hostile ship. Your orders are to hold your ground and provide diversion until the other squad exit the carrier. Utilize all possible means you have at your disposal to survive.

Lady out.

# Mission Details:

The engagement is to happen in the open environment of space. Several debris and ship remains are scattered across the zone, providing not only cover but also multiple ways to break line of sight with enemy units. Alongside the debris are live munition, bound to react at the slightest provocation. Expect a balanced group of skirmishers supported by long-range units. The objective is considered accomplished after surviving for a set number of rounds.
