# A Word From The Boss...

Have you slept well these past 10 years, Orchids? I hope so, because you will be wanting to do a little bit of fighting to keep your new home unmolested. Unfortunately, we are being victim of the noble, age-old tradition of space piracy. We are not fully aware of their numbers or identity, but we are aware the group is housed within a small frigate-class. A punch beyond what the Thalin Estel can take. Hence our plan: To use a local asteroid belt as a screen, and force a more personal engagement midst the rocks and debris. You are to spread yourselves across one of the belt's sectors, and wait in ambush. Hopefully after bloodying the noses a bit, they will surrender any thoughts of stealing our stuff. Well? That's it. Off to space with you. Don't forget to take pictures. I hear the first time is always special.

The engagement shall happen in an asteroid field. Signatures from the approaching frames indicates a varied array of frames based on hacking and close quarters skirmishing, group coordinated skirmishing, so be aware. The asteroids with blue cracks are rich in iron, making them the most optimal for cover. The mission will be accomplished once enough targets have been eliminated. Good luck.
