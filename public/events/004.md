# Word From The Boss:

Maddie here. So you have chosen the big gamble. The hail mary. I must commend all of you, and I respect the audacity of all parties. But you don't want my respect. You want to survive.

Well? Get to it. Good luck on your draw. And if lady luck does not smile upon us, see you in hell.

Maddie out.

# Mission Details:

The objective for each squadron, is to survival a total of seven rounds, with reinforcements arriving after every couple rounds. Alongside reinforcements, a payload targetting the Thalin Estel shall arrive. Focus must be diverted towards the payload, lest it damages the vessel, leaving it incapable for space faring. Recommended focus on swift enemy control and management. The hazardous proximity to the Tarf Star presents a hazard to a frame's reactor. +1 Heat shall be added at the end of every combatant's turn.

The zone is largely empty of environmental obstacles. It is up to the pilots themselves to prepare the field in advance.
