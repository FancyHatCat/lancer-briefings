# Word From The Boss:

Maddie here. You got a special job. While the other squadron busy themselves by making everyone busy as well, the four of you get to play the unique duty of escorting Richard and his boys down into where we assume is located the lost cargo. Fun, right? Though most of the attention will be elsewhere, do not think you will be able to reach the entry point unmolested. Remember, simple and clean. Defend those boys, let them do their job, then get out.

That is all. Good luck on your draw.

Maddie out.

# Mission Details:

The focus point of the mission is the shuttle carrying Richard's Pirates. Its survival is tantamount, and the destruction of it will mean immediate mission failure. Expect middle to long-range capable foes, and weapons with AoE capacities to be heavily utilized. Once reached the base's entry point, the squadron must hold and protect it for up to three rounds. Once Richard's pirates collect the cargo, the team must escort the shuttle back to the Zone of Ingress, thus completing the mission.
